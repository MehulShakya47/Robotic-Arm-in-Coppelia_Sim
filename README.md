# Robotic-Arm-in-Coppelia_Sim
This is a controller and simulation file for a robotic arm- namely "uarm with gripper",chosen from the inbuilt templates for robots in Coppelia_Sim simulation software.<br>
This was a project built alongside with my colleagues, 1st year undergrads. We were successfully able to make a GUI for controlling the functionality of the robot, and also implement terminal controls for robot handling.<br>
For using the robot download the zip file, after extraction you will see 2 files- namely "ReadMe" and "terminal instructions", go through those for the further instructions
of using the robot.<br>
Thanks for reading.
